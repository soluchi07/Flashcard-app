# Explore Mars! – NASA Rover Photo Explorer

**Author:** Soluchi Fidel-Ibeabuchi
**Role:** Developer | Computer Science Student @ Howard University

**Explore Mars!** is an interactive React web app that fetches **real Mars rover images from NASA’s Curiosity Rover API**. Users can generate random rover photos, view metadata such as **launch date, landing date, Earth date, and camera type**, and dynamically filter results through a custom **ban list system**.

This project highlights my ability to **integrate external APIs, handle JSON data, and design state-driven interactive features**.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

* **Randomized Image Fetching:** Generates a new Curiosity Rover photo with every button click.
* **Consistent Metadata Display:** Displays rover metadata alongside each photo.
* **Ban List Filtering:** Users can ban specific attributes (e.g., a camera type), preventing them from appearing in future results.
* **Real-Time Ban Management:** Attributes can be removed from the ban list instantly, restoring them to future queries.
* **Focused Display:** Only one image/metadata pair is shown at a time for clarity.

### Future Enhancements

* Multi-attribute filtering (e.g., exclude both camera types and Earth dates).
* Session-based history to track previously viewed images.
